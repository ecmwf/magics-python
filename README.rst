Magics is the latest generation of the ECMWF's meteorological plotting software and can be either
accessed directly through its Python or Fortran interfaces or by using Metview.


Features:

- supports plotting of contours, wind fields, observations, satellite images, symbols, text, axis and graphs (including boxplots)
- can plot GRIB 1 and 2 coded data, gaussian grid, regularly spaced grid and fitted data

Limitations:

- development stage: **Alpha**,


Installation
------------

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install Magics


System dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The python module depends on the ECMWF *Magics* library
that must be installed on the system and accessible as a shared library.
Some Linux distributions ship a binary version that may be installed with the standard package manager.
On Ubuntu 18.04 use the command::

    $ sudo apt-get install libmagplus3v5

As an alternative you may install the official source distribution
by following the instructions at
https://software.ecmwf.int/magics/Installation+Guide

Note that *Magics* support for the Windows operating system is experimental.

You may run a simple selfcheck command to ensure that your system is set up correctly::

    $ python -m Magics selfcheck
    Found: Magics '4.0.0'.
    Your system is ready.

If it does not work out of the box, try setting up the path to your MagPlus installation beforehand::

    $ export MAGPLUS_HOME=/usr/local/opt/magics-4.9.3


Usage
-----

First, you need a well-formed GRIB file, if you don't have one at hand you can download our
a 2m temperature grib file::

    $ wget http://download.ecmwf.int/test-data/magics/2m_temperature.grib


You may try out the high level API in a python interpreter::

   from Magics import macro as magics

   name = 'magics'
   #Setting of the output file name
   output = magics.output(output_formats = ['png'],
    		output_name_first_page_number = "off",
    		output_name = "magics")

   #Import the  data
   data =  magics.mgrib(grib_input_file_name  = "2m_temperature.grib", )

   #Apply an automatic styling
   contour = magics.mcont( contour_automatic_setting = "ecmwf", )
   coast = magics.mcoast()
   magics.plot(output, data, contour, coast)


Running the test program will create a png named magics.png
